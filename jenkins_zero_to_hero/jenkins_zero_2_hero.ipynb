    "- We can add users and create and assign roles to those users through role based plugin\n",
    "- We can also have __item roles__ that uses regex pattern and thus we can use it to match jobs and restrict its access to only certain users by assigning that item role to specific users\n",
    "- We can also define our own __ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES__\n",
    "- We can run __job periodically__ (e.g backup job / nigthly job) using cron syntax under build trigger for that job\n",
    "- We can also use CRUMB plugin to allow building jobs using external bash scripts\n",

    "- In the devops world, the code that is build by a compiler is called `artifact`. For example, java code build using maven compiler produces jar file and it can be called as an artifact.\n",
    "- Running that artifact is called deployment. For example by running \"java -jar /address/of/jar\" we are deploying it locally in our system.\n",
    "- We can use email notification and configure our jobs to notify us if it fails\n",
    "- Most common stages in Jenkins: build -> test -> deploy -> archive artifact\n",
    "- We can use git hooks to trigger build using crumb. Remember with crumb we can invoke job with external script. So in .git folder of a repo, we can create a folder (e.g custom_hook) and put a .sh file (e.g post_receive.sh). That file can use crum to curl post the build job. So, whenever anyone pushes any code to that repo, hook under .git gets triggered and thus a shell script in it which invokest the jenkins job using crumb.\n"
