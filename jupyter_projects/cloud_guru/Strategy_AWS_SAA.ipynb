    "__1. Designing Resilient Architecture__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.1 Choose resilient storage - as even in case of disaster your data is not lost\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2 Determine how to design decoupling mechanisms using AWS services - as it ensures if 1 tier or component fails, others are not impacted\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.3 Determine how to design multi-tier architecture - as they are naturally decoupled and each scale independently\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.4 Determine how to design HA and fault tolerant architecture\n",
    "   \n",
    "> Block storage like EBS allows for change in bytes whereas with object storage like S3 and Glacier we need to replace the entire object\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for Resilient Storage:\n",
    "- Instance Store: emphemeral and usually for caching and processing data for performance but not permanent\n",
    "- EBS: decoupled from EC2\n",
    "- EFS: one per VPC, Linux AMI only\n",
    "- S3: standard S3 (where access is cheap but storage is expensive), S3-IA (where storage is cheap but access is expensive); 99.999999999 durability; encryption in transit by HTTP; encryption at rest by SSE-S3, SSE-KMS or SSE-C\n",
    "- Glacier: encrypts data by default; best option is to have lifecycle policy to move data from S3 to glacier\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoupling:\n",
    "- SQS\n",
    "- ELB\n",
    "\n",
    "> RTO (Recovery Time Objective) is time to recover; RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is how much data is lost\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Axioms on Resilient Architecture:\n",
    "- Expect Single AZ will never be right answer\n",
    "- Fault tolerant and HA are not same thing (HA says system is always up and can fail over on failure; Fault tolerant says system can conceal its failure from users and there is no loss of service)\n",

    "\n",
    "2.1 Choose performant storage and databases\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "CloudFront:\n",
    "- can be used both for static and dynamic contents\n",
    "- dynamic content with TTL set to 0 but what is the benefit as we're not getting caching here. (benefit: so that Amazon's backbone network can be used for read and write)\n",
    "- origins: S3 (for static), EC2, ELB, HTTP servers\n",
