    "__1. Designing Resilient Architecture__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.1 Choose resilient storage - as even in case of disaster your data is not lost\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2 Determine how to design decoupling mechanisms using AWS services - as it ensures if 1 tier or component fails, others are not impacted\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.3 Determine how to design multi-tier architecture - as they are naturally decoupled and each scale independently\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.4 Determine how to design HA and fault tolerant architecture\n",
    "   \n",
    "> Block storage like EBS allows for change in bytes whereas with object storage like S3 and Glacier we need to replace the entire object\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for Resilient Storage:\n",
    "- Instance Store: emphemeral and usually for caching and processing data for performance but not permanent\n",
    "- EBS: decoupled from EC2\n",
    "- EFS: one per VPC, Linux AMI only\n",
    "- S3: standard S3 (where access is cheap but storage is expensive), S3-IA (where storage is cheap but access is expensive); 99.999999999 durability; encryption in transit by HTTP; encryption at rest by SSE-S3, SSE-KMS or SSE-C\n",
    "- Glacier: encrypts data by default; best option is to have lifecycle policy to move data from S3 to glacier\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoupling:\n",
    "- SQS\n",
    "- ELB\n",
    "\n",
    "> RTO (Recovery Time Objective) is time to recover; RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is how much data is lost\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Axioms on Resilient Architecture:\n",
    "- Expect Single AZ will never be right answer\n",
    "- Fault tolerant and HA are not same thing (HA says system is always up and can fail over on failure; Fault tolerant says system can conceal its failure from users and there is no loss of service)\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Design Performant Architectures__\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Choose performant storage and databases\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Apply caching\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Design solutions for elasticity and scalibily\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for Performant Storage:\n",
    "- the first thing to choose for EBS storage is to go for SSD or HDD\n",
    "- the other thing to do is to load all static contents to S3\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 Payment Model:\n",
    "_Pay what you use_\n",
    "- GBs/month\n",
    "- Transfer out of region\n",
    "- API requests (GET, POST, PUT, COPY, LIST)\n",
    "_Free_\n",
    "- Transfer in to S3\n",
    "- Transfer out from S3 to CloudFront or in same region\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for Performant Database:\n",
    "- RDS vs DynamoDB vs Redshift (when to choose what?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching:\n",
    "- CloudFront\n",
    "- Elastic Cache: Memcached(simpler use case), Redis(complex use case)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Remember with cache you don't want to put some data that is critical and needs update for the user e.g among shopping cart, product catalog and bank account balance, you should not store account balance in cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudFront:\n",
    "- can be used both for static and dynamic contents\n",
    "- dynamic content with TTL set to 0 but what is the benefit as we're not getting caching here. (benefit: so that Amazon's backbone network can be used for read and write)\n",
    "- origins: S3 (for static), EC2, ELB, HTTP servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticity and Scalibility:\n",
    "- ELB, ASG and CloudWatch\n",
    "> Terminologies: vertical scaling (up and down), horizontal scaling (in and out)\n",

    "\n",
    "Subnets: use subnets to define internet accessibility\n",
    "Public subnet: to support inbound/outbound traffic to public internet, include routing table entry to __internet gateway__\n",
    "Private subnet: do not have routing table entry to internet gateway; to support restricted outbound only public internet access, use a \"jump-box\" (NAT, proxy, bastion host)\n",
    "\n",
    "SG vs NACL:\n",
    "- sg applies to eni; nacl applies to subnet\n",
    "- stateful; stateless\n",
    "- explicit allow only; explicit allow or deny\n",
    "\n",
    "Services to get traffic in and out of your VPC:\n",
    "1. Internet gateway: enables connection to the internet\n",
    "2. Virtual Private gateway: enables connection to the customer datacenter through vpn or direct connect\n",
    "3. AWS Direct Connect: dedicated pipe b/w datacenter and AWS\n",
    "4. VPC Peering: connect to other VPCs\n",
    "5. NAT Gateways: allow outgoing internet traffic from private subnets\n",

    "- Client side encryption:\n",
    "    - KMS Managed master key encryption (CSE-KMS)\n",
    "    - Customer managed master key encryption (CSE-C)\n",
