    "- Remember the use case of SWF and it's action tasker (used example of gmail percentage of storage left), its collaboration with DynamoDB + SES\n",
    "- Remember the use case of any upload media website like FB (use of SIF + multi-part upload (has features like upload without complete knowledge of size)\n",
    "- For RDS running on EC2 instances with EBS attached vol, use Provisioned IOPS EBS + EBS-Optimized Instance type, if RDS is bottlenecked\n",
    "- __innoDB__ is the recommended storage engine for MySQL DB instances on RDS while __xtraDB__ storage engine for MariaDB\n",
    "- AWS Config: shows what resources we have now; IAM Credentials Report: allows auditing credentials and login\n",
    "- DR: AMI for EC2 backup; Snapshot for EBS Volume; asyncronous db backup on S3(slow service) or EBS or EC2 instance for RDS\n",
    "- Keep rapidly accessed data to EBS/RDS which offer high IOPS rather than on S3\n",
    "- Gateway-cached volumes utilizes S3 for primary data backup, while retaining frequently accessed data locally in a cache.\n",
    "- Gateway-stored volumes stores the complete primary data locally, while asynchronously backing up that data to AWS (offsite backup)\n",

    "**Gateway-Stored Volume**\n",
    "- Gateway-stored volumes maintain the entire data set locally to provide low latency access\n",
    "- Gateway asynchronously backs up point-in-time snapshots (in the form of EBS snapshots) of the data to S3 which provides durable off-site backups\n",
