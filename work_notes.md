DevOps Notes:

- **Machine image**
	- It usually contains pre-installed OS and software packages. Amazon provides machine image which we can _launch->configure->create image->launch_
	- Once we launch it, it's called running machine
	- Machine image can also be termed "pre-baked" image
	- To launch the pre-baked image we can use "Launch template"

- **Packer**
	- It's a tool provided by HashiCorp to create "pre-baked" images
	- In AWS, we can do this with CloudFormation itself
	- Packer does not manage the image. Packer only builds images. After they're built, it is up to you to launch or destroy them
	(HashiCorp has separate tool for creating pre-baked images (packer) and separate tool for provisioning (terraform). We just need to create a JSON file and pass installation script as user-data as part of creation in terraform and it will take care of developing the AMI for us.)

- **Ansible**
	- It's a configuration management tool that can be used to install packages
	- It's other alternatives are Chef, Puppet and Salt
